This document is about [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) in general but will focus on [NVIDIA Jetson devices](https://developer.nvidia.com/buy-jetson) (TX1, TX2, Nano, Xavier AGX/NX...).

**Starting version 3.1.0** we support full GPGPU acceleration for [NVIDIA Jetson devices](https://developer.nvidia.com/buy-jetson) using [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) and [TF-TRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html).

 - The SDK was tested using [JetPack 4.4.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) and [JetPack 5.1.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack), the latest version from NVIDIA and **we will not provide technical support if you're using any other version**.
 - This repo contains two set of binaries: [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) and [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt)

# Getting started #
As explained above, we use both [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) and [TF-TRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html).
 * [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) is used for:

[NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) is natively supported by all Jetson devices once flashed with [Jetpack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) while [TF-TRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html) requires [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) binaries with TensorRT support. 
You don't need to worry about building Tensorflow with support for TensorRT by yourself, this repo contains all required binaries.

<a name="getting-started_requirements"></a>
## Requirements ##
We require [JetPack 4.4.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) or [JetPack 5.1.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack). As of today (***February 20, 2023***), version 5.1.0 is the latest one.
If you run `apt-cache show nvidia-jetpack | grep "Version:"`, you'll have:
  - `Version: 4.4.1-b50\nVersion: 4.4-b186\nVersion: 4.4-b144` if you're using Jetpack 4.4.1
  - `Version: 5.1-b147` if you're using Jetpack 5.1.0

Supported devices (check https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack for up to date info):
  - `Jetpack 5.1.0:` Jetson AGX Orin 32 GB production module, Jetson AGX Orin Developer Kit, Jetson Orin NX 16GB production module, Jetson AGX Xavier series, Jetson Xavier NX series modules, Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit and Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit.
  - `Jetpack 4.4.1:` Jetson Nano, Jetson Xavier NX, Jetson TX1 and Jetson TX2.

## Before trying to use the SDK on Jetson ##
Please note that this repo doesn't contain optimized TensorRT models and **you'll not be able to use the SDK** unless you generate these models. More info about model optimization at https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/developer-guide/index.html. Fortunately we made this task very easy by writing an optimizer using TensorRT C++.

<a name="getting-started_before-trying-to-use-the-sdk-on-jetson_building-optimized-models"></a>
<a name="building-optimized-models"></a>
### Building optimized models ###
This process will write the optimized models (a.k.a plans) to the local disk which means we'll need write permission. We recommend running the next commands as root(#) instead of normal user($).
To generate the optimized models:
 - Navigate to the jetson binaries folder: `cd ultimateALPR-SDK/binaries/jetson/aarch64` or `cd ultimateALPR-SDK/binaries/jetson_tftrt/aarch64`
 - Generate the optimized models: `sudo chmod +x ./prepare.sh && sudo ./prepare.sh`
 
This will build the models using CUDA engine and serialize the optimized models into [assets/models.tensorrt/optimized](assets/models.tensorrt/optimized). Please note that **the task will last several minutes and you must be patient**. Next time you run this task it will be faster as only newest models will be generated. So, you can interrupt the process and next time it will continue from where it ended the last time.

For [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) the [prepare.sh](binaries/jetson_tftrt/aarch64/prepare.sh) script will also download Tensorflow libraries which means you'll need internet connection. You'll only need to run the script once.

Models generated on a Jetson device with [Compute Capabilities](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) X and TensorRT version Y will only be usable on devices matching this configuration. For example, **you'll not be able to use models generated on Jetson TX2 ([Compute Capabilities](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) 6.2) on a Jetson nano ([Compute Capabilities](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) 5.3)**.

<a name="getting-started_jetson-versus-jetsontftrt"></a>
## [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) versus [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) ##
If you navigate to the [binaries](binaries) you'll see that there are 2 **'jetson'** folders: [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) and [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt).

**To make it short:** Both versions use [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) GPGPU acceleration for the detection and classification while only [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) uses GPGPU acceleration for [License Plate Recognition (LPR)](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/anpr/docs/Features.html#license-plate-recognition-lpr) (a.k.a OCR).

[binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) is very fast when [parallel mode](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/anpr/docs/Parallel_versus_sequential_processing.html) is enabled as we'll perform the detection and classification on GPU and the recognition/OCR on CPU. [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) is faster as all operations (detection, classification, OCR...) are done on GPU.

For now we have failed to convert the [License Plate Recognition (LPR)](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/anpr/docs/Features.html#license-plate-recognition-lpr) model to [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) and this is why we're using [TF-TRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html) which comes with many issues: large binary size, high memory usage, slow load and initialization... We're working to have [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) for all models and completly remove Tensorflow.

<a name="getting-started_jetson-versus-jetsontftrt_pros-and-cons"></a>
### Pros and Cons ###
 - [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson)
    - Pros:
       - Low memory usage
       - Fast load and initialization
    - Cons:
       - High CPU usage
       - Lower frame rate when there are license plates on the image. [License Plate Recognition (LPR)](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/anpr/docs/Features.html#license-plate-recognition-lpr) **NOT** GPGPU accelerated
       
       
 - [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt)
     - Pros:
       - Low CPU usage
       - Higher frame rate when there are license plates on the image. [License Plate Recognition (LPR)](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/anpr/docs/Features.html#license-plate-recognition-lpr) **IS** GPGPU accelerated using [TF-TRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html)
    - Cons:
       - High memory usage. [TF-TRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html) binaries are >500Mo and this doesn't help.
       - Slow load and initialization. For now we cannot generated the optimized models for the OCR part using [TF-TRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html), the models are built and optimized at runtime before inference.

To check GPU and CPU usage: `/usr/bin/tegrastats`

<a name="getting-started_jetson-versus-jetsontftrt_recommendations"></a>
### Recommendations ###

We recommend using [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) for your devs as it loads very fast and switch to [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) for production. [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) may be slow to load and initialize but once it's done the frame rate is higher.

On Jetson Xavier AGX, [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) may be faster than [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt). Check [issue #128](https://github.com/DoubangoTelecom/ultimateALPR-SDK/issues/128) on why.

If [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) is still slow to load and initialize, then use [binaries/linux/aarch64]([binaries/linux/aarch64) which are a very light binaries using Tensorflow Lite (less than 13Mo total size).

<a name="benchmark"></a>
# Benchmark #
Here are some benchmark numbers to compare the speed. For more information about the **positive rate**, please check https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/anpr/docs/Benchmark.html. The benchmark application is open source and could be found at [samples/c++/benchmark](samples/c%2B%2B/benchmark).

Before running the benchmark application:
 - For Jetson nano, make sure you're using a Barrel Jack (5V-4A) power supply instead of microUSB port (5V-2A)
 - Put the device on maximum performance mode: `sudo nvpmodel -m 0 && sudo jetson_clocks`.


To run the benchmark application for [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) with 0.2 positive rate for 100 loops:
```
cd ulatimateALPR-SDK/binaries/jetson/aarch64
chmod +x benchmark
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./benchmark \
    --positive ../../../assets/images/lic_us_1280x720.jpg \
    --negative ../../../assets/images/london_traffic.jpg \
    --assets ../../../assets \
    --charset latin \
    --loops 100 \
    --rate 0.2 \
    --parallel true
```

You can notice that [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) and [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) have the same fps when positive rate is 0.0 (no plate in the stream) but the gap widen when the rate increase (more plates in the stream). This can be explained by the fact that both use [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) to accelerate the license plate and car detection but only [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) uses GPGPU acceleration for [License Plate Recognition (LPR)](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/anpr/docs/Features.html#license-plate-recognition-lpr) (thanks to [TF-TRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html)).

[binaries/linux/aarch64](binaries/linux/aarch64) contains generic Linux binaries for AArch64 (a.k.a ARM64) devices. All operations are done on CPU. The performance boost between this CPU-only version and the Jetson-based ones may not seem impressive but there is a good reason: [binaries/linux/aarch64](binaries/linux/aarch64) uses INT8 inference while the Jetson-based versions use a mix of FP32 and FP16 **which means more accurate**. Providing INT8 models for Jetson devices is on our roadmap with no ETA.

<a name="jetson-nano-versus-Raspberry-Pi-4"></a>
# Jetson nano versus Raspberry Pi 4 #
**On average the SDK is 3 times faster on Jetson nano compared to Raspberry Pi 4** and this may not seem impressive but there is a good reason: [binaries/raspbian/armv7l](binaries/raspbian/armv7l) uses INT8 inference while the Jetson-based binaries ([binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) and [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt)) use a mix of FP32 and FP16 **which means more accurate**. Providing INT8 models for Jetson devices is on our roadmap with no ETA.

<a name="jetson-nx-versus-jetso-tx2"></a>
# Jetson Xavier NX versus Jetson TX2 #
Jetson Xavier NX and Jetson TX2 are proposed at the same price ($399) but **NX has 4.6 times more compute power than TX2 for FP16**: *6 TFLOPS versus 1.3 TFLOPS*.

**We highly recommend using Xavier NX instead of TX2.**

<a name="pre-processing-operations"></a>
# Pre-processing operations #
Please note that even when your're using [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) some pre-processing operations are performed on CPU and this why the CPU usage is at 1/5th. You don't need to worry about these operations, they are massively multi-threaded and entirely written in assembler with **SIMD NEON** acceleration. These functions are open source and you can find them at:

<a name="coming-next"></a>
# Coming next #
Version 3.1.0 is the first release to support NVIDIA Jetson and there is room for optimizations. Adding support for full INT8 inference could **improve the speed by up to 700%**. We're also planing to move the NMS layer from the GPU to the CPU and rewrite the code in assembler with **NEON SIMD**.

<a name="known-issues-and-possible-fixes"></a>
# Known issues and possible fixes #

<a name="known-issues-and-possible-fixes_warnings-to-ignore"></a>
## Warnings you can safely ignore ##
All warnings from NVIDIA logger will be logged as errors on model optimization process. You can safely ignore the following messages:
  - `Your ONNX model has been generated with INT64 weights, while TensorRT does not natively support INT64. Attempting to cast down to INT32.`
  - `53 weights are affected by this issue: Detected subnormal FP16 values.`
  - `The implicit batch dimension mode has been deprecated. Please create the network with NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag::kEXPLICIT_BATCH flag whenever possible.`

<a name="known-issues-and-possible-fixes_failed-to-open-file"></a>
## Failed to open file ##
You may receive `[UltAlprSdkTRT] Failed to open file` error after running `./prepare.sh` script if we fail to write to the local disk. We recommend running the script as root(#) instead of normal user($). 

<a name="known-issues-and-possible-fixes_slow-load-and-initialization"></a>
## Slow load and initialization ##
When your're using [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) the OCR models are built using CUDA engines at runtime before running the inference. Building the models is very slow (**several minutes**) and not suitable in dev stage. We recommend using [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) for your devs as it loads very fast and switch to [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) for production. [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) may be slow to load and initialize but once it's done the frame rate is higher (**x2 times higher**).

<a name="known-issues-and-possible-fixes_high-memory-usage"></a>
## High memory usage ##
Disabling [parallel mode](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/anpr/docs/Parallel_versus_sequential_processing.html) alone could decrease the memory usage by 50%. Off course disabling [parallel mode](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/anpr/docs/Parallel_versus_sequential_processing.html) will slowdown the frame rate by up to 60%.

[binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) is the faster version but it depends on [TF-TRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html) which is very large (>500Mo). Try with [binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) which is very small (less than 13Mo total size).

<a name="known-issues-and-possible-fixes_high-cpu-usage"></a>
## High CPU usage ##
[binaries/jetson](binaries/jetson) uses the CPU for the OCR part. Use [binaries/jetson_tftrt](binaries/jetson_tftrt) for full GPGPU acceleration to significantly reduce CPU usage.
